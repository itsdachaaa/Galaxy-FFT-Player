# Project Goal

The main goal was to create a working media player in p5.js that:

1. Plays audio
2. Includes Play/Pause + Volume control
3. Shows a smooth, real-time FFT visualiser
4. Reacts clearly to bass, mids, and treble frequencies

# What I Built

## Media Player Features

1. Song selection dropdown
2. Forward/Backward buttons
3. Play & Pause
4. Time scrubber
5. Live timestamp
6. Vertical volume slider

## FFT Visualiser

1. Built using p5.sound + p5.FFT
2. Real time audio frequency analysis
3. Smooth reaction to bass, mids, and treble
4. Galaxy themed animation

## User Interface

1. Polished, centered layout
2. Consistent spacing + neon galaxy theme
3. Inspired by the concept sketch on page 3

# How the Visualiser Reacts to Sound

## Treble → Ripple Effects

1. **Low treble** → soft, rounded ripple edges
2. **High treble** → sharp, spiky ripple edges
3. Creates a shimmering star-like motion

## Mids → Core Colour + Ring Movement

1. **Mid frequencies** shift the core **colour (Purple → Pink)**
2. **Inner ring** moves in a circular back and forth motion
3. Adds movement inside the galaxy

## Bass → Galaxy Expansion + Colour Change

1. **Bass** makes the entire galaxy **expand + pulse**
2. **Outer ring** colour shifts from **Blue (low) → Purple (high)**
3. Represents Galaxy Pulse Strength
